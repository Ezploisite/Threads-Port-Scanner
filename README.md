# Threads Port Scanner


This script will scan 10000 TCP/UDP ports in about 6 seconds. It all depends on the hardware configuration of your machine.   



## Getting Started

First you will need to create a ssh key inside your machine and properly filling in all the required fields.




(1) Let's give the script the execution rights 
```
chmod +x Scanner.py 
```
(2) Run the script 
```
./Scanner.py
```

## Recommendations

The script makes a lot of noise since it creates a thread for each port it will scan. Remember, use it only locally or on environments where you are allowed!
